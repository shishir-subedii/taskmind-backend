# TaskMind 🧠✨
AI-powered project management assistant that takes the chaos out of team coordination.  
Instead of manually writing meeting notes, assigning tasks, and sending reminders, managers can simply type or speak instructions — TaskMind turns them into structured tasks, assigns them to the right team members, updates the project dashboard, and sends personalized notifications.
